# Output:
# this will always be run
# b is greater than a
# this will also always be run
# Explanation:
# In the above code, we have defined two variables a and b and assigned them values 4586 and 74534 respectively.
# Then we have used an if-else statement to compare the values of a and b. Since the value of b is greater than a, the output will be:
# b is greater than a
# The last print statement will also
