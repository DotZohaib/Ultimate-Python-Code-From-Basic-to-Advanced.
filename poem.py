      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are!
      Up above the world so high,
      Like a diamond in the sky.
      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are

      Blue fire, in the sky so blue,
      Like a unicorn in the sky.
      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are
      And the brightest star, in the sky,
      Like a moon shining bright.

      And the brightest star, in the sky,
      Like a sunrise in the sky.
      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are


      And the brightest star, in the sky,
      Like a sunset in the sky.
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are
